      "uses": "Its chief therapeutic use depends on its vaso-constriction action; therefore a most powerful and prompt astringent and haemostatic; and invaluable in checking capillary haemorrhages, from all parts, where local or direct application is feasible: nose, ear, mouth, throat, larynx, stomach, rectum, uterus, bladder. Haemorrhagic condition not due to defective coagulation of the blood. Complete bloodlessness, ischemia, may be induced with impunity. Locally, solutions (1: 10,000-1: 1,000) sprayed or applied on cotton have been very efficient in bloodless operations about the eye, nose, throat, and larynx.",
      "caution": "On account of its affinity for oxygen, the drug easily decomposes in watery and dilute acid solutions. The solution must be protected from air and light. It must not be too frequently repeated, owing to cardiac and arterial lesions. For homeopathic use 2x to 6x attenuation."

    "description": "Therapeutically, Adrenaline has been suggested in acute congestion of lungs, Asthma, Grave's and Addison's diseases, arterio-sclerosis, chronic aortitis, angina pectoris, haemophilia chlorosis, hay fever, serum rashes, acute urticaria, etc. Dr. P. Jousset reports success in treating, homeopathically, cases of angina and of aortitis, sub-acute and chronic, when Adrenaline has been prescribed per os and in infinitesimal dose. The symptom guiding to this is, Sensation of thoracic constriction with anguish. This, with vertigo, nausea and vomiting have been produced by the drug. Abdominal pain. Shock or heart failure during anaesthesia, as it causes very prompt rise of blood pressure by its action on nerve endings in the vessel wall.",

To be effective the permanganate must come in direct contact with the opium or morphine in the stomach; hypodermatic or intravenous injections are absolutely useless, as the salt would be decomposed by the blood serum at once. The approved treatment is administration of two to five grains of potassium permanganate in dilute aqueous solution as soon as possible after the poison is taken, this amounts to be increased if very large doses of the poison have been taken. Washing out the stomach with a quantity of 1 to 500 solution of permanganate is also recommended, using at least a pint of this solution either by a stomach pump or by enforced vomiting.

    "description": "Strophanthus is a muscle poison; it increases the contractile power of all striped muscles. Acts on the heart; increasing the systole and diminishes the rapidity. May be used with advantage to tone the heart, and run off dropsical accumulations. In small doses for weak heart; it feels enlarged. In mitral regurgitation, where edema and dropsy have supervened (Digit). Strophanthus occasions no gastric distress, has no cumulative effects, is a greater diuretic, and is safer for the aged, as it does not affect the vaso-motors. In pneumonia and in severe prostration from haemorrhage after operations and acute diseases. After the long use of stimulants; irritable heart of tobacco-smokers. Arterio-sclerosis; rigid arteries of aged. Restores tone to a brittle tissue, especially of the heart muscle and valves. Especially useful in failing compensation dependent upon fatty heart. Hives. Anaemia with palpitation and breathlessness. Exophthalmia goitre. Corpulent persons.",
