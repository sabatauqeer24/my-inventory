Causes no haemorrhage but only edema, hence the victims of this reptile frequently bear very little sign of external injury a small scratch or puncture being the only indication where the fangs have worked their havoc. The tissue lying beneath the wound is colored dark purple, and a large quantity of viscid blood-like fluid collects in the vicinity of the wound. An intense burning pain at the spot bitten is the first symptom. In man there follows an interval before fresh symptoms occur. The average is about an hour. Once developed, the symptoms follow a rapid course. A feeling of intoxication is produced, followed by a loss of power over the limbs. The patient is bereft of speech, swallowing, and the control over the movement of the lips. The saliva is ejected in large quantities, the respiration gradually becomes slower and slower, and at length ceases. Conscious all time. Is not a haemorrhagic or septic, medicine like Lachesis and Crotalus. Its action settles around the heart; valvular troubles. Marked surging of blood upwards, marked dyspnea, inability to lie on left side. Hypertrophy, and valvular lesions. Organs seem to be drawn together. Very susceptible to cold.
